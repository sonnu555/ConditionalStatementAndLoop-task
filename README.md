This project contains solutions to **50 JavaScript conditional statements** and **19 loop-based problems**. It's a great resource for beginners who want to strengthen their understanding of
decision-making and iteration in JavaScript.
50 Conditional Statement Problems
This section includes JavaScript code examples that use `if`, `else if`, `else`,  and operators.

Each problem tests your understanding of:
- Comparison operators (`==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
- Logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
- Input validation
- Simple real-world examples like:
  - Checking if a number is even or odd
  - Age-based access control
  - Grade categorization
  - Prime number checking
  - Day of the week detection (e.g., weekday or weekend)
  - Temperature or weather-based responses
  - Leap year checking


19 Loop-Based Problems
This section includes solutions using JavaScript loops:

Some problems covered:
- Multiplication tables
- Sum of numbers
- Pattern printing (stars, numbers)
- Array iteration
  
- Reversing numbers or strings
- Loop-based conditional problems (e.g., print only even numbers from 1 to 20)
